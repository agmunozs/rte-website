subtitle: At Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory

The Real-Time Earth initiative is grounded in the idea that observations drive scientific discovery,
and that the Earth sciences are on the threshold of a real-time scientific revolution supported by the
proliferation of networked sensors, instruments, devices, and platforms. These sensor systems will
enable innovative scientific investigations spanning a large range of spatial and temporal scales and
give scientists unprecedented insights into numerous dynamic and interconnected processes on this planet.
The Real-Time Earth initiative will help Lamont scientists realize their ideas for making novel
measurements and developing connected sensor systems by establishing the Technology Innovation Center.
This center will serve as a technology incubator providing Lamont scientists with the tools and resources
they need to continue leading the real-time science revolution.
