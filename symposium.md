title: RTE Data Science Symposium
subtitle: Monell Auditorium, March 7, 2017
---

The goal of this symposium is to bring together scientists from the broader Lamont community whose work involves innovative aspects of data science. We will learn about each other’s approaches to and existing capabilities for data management, analysis, and visualization; search for common ground across disciplines; and discuss how to face coming challenges and opportunities in the era of big data.
