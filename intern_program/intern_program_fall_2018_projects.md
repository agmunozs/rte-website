## Potential Projects for Fall 2018

### Video Image Analysis of Deep-Sea Chemosynthesizing Bacteria

#### Supervisor
Tim Crone, Lamont Associate Research Professor

#### Description
The Cabled Array, a part of NSF’s Ocean Observatories Initiative, is the most advanced submarine volcanic observatory in the world, connecting over 100 deep-sea oceanographic instruments to shore through ~800 kilometers of fiber-optic cable. The array hosts a high-definition seafloor camera system (CamHD) which surveys a hydrothermal vent and bacterial mat colonies on the seafloor every three hours. For approximately three years the camera has accumulated over 100 TB of video data showing these mats and the potential effects of seismic, magmatic, and hydrothermal processes on the bacterial colonies in this environment. In this project you will use a Dask-enabled Python image analysis pipeline to establish a bacterial mat “colonization quotient” to study the temporal evolution of these organisms, and consider potential relationships between the bacterial activity and geological and geophysical processes.

#### Skills Required
Python programming, image analysis


### Building a Cloud Optimized Climate Data Catalog

#### Supervisor
[Ryan Abernathey](https://rabernat.github.io/), Associate Professor

#### Description
The [Pangeo Project](http://pangeo-data.org) aims to make it easier for geoscientists to work with Big Data, by creating environments for data analysis in the cloud. 
These environments are based on open-source python data science tools such as Jupyter, Xarray, Dask, and Kubernetes.
A major challenge when transitioning research to the cloud is how to store datasets in a way that best takes advantages of the [object storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage) on cloud platforms.
We are experimenting with storing data in the [Zarr](http://zarr.readthedocs.io/) format on Google Cloud Platform.
We would like someone to develop a data catalog based on [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to make these datasets more easily searchable and discoverable by users of <http://pangeo.pydata.org>.
This includes building a `.json` catalog of the existing datasets, integration and testing of the catalog with Intake, and development of a web page for browsing and searching the catalog.

#### Skills Required
Python programming, basic knowledge of html

### Modeling time in the IRI Data Library (DL): new functionality needed

#### Supervisor
Rémi COUSIN, Climate Information Analyst

#### Description
The IRI DL allows for the online analysis of hundreds of variables by the scientific or practice community. A new batch of variables comes from so called subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) climate models outputs that are issued every day or at a lesser frequency, with daily lead times up to typically 40 days. The time dimensions of those outputs need to be manipulated, sampled, aggregated, to match the time dimension of other variables so that they can be compared (e.g. against other models, observations). The IRI DL Ingrid programming language can already achieve a lot to manipulate and transform time, however, new easy-to-use functions are needed to facilitate these manipulations for non-Ingrid experts. The intern will familiarize her/himself with Ingrid and develop new easy-to-use Ingrid functions to perform time analyses on S2S variables.

#### Skills Required
Willing to learn Ingrid programming language
