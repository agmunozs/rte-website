# Potential Projects

## Video Image Analysis of Deep-Sea Chemosynthesizing Bacteria

### Supervisor
Tim Crone, Lamont Associate Research Professor

### Description
The Cabled Array, a part of NSF’s Ocean Observatories Initiative, is the most advanced submarine volcanic observatory in the world, connecting over 100 deep-sea oceanographic instruments to shore through ~800 kilometers of fiber-optic cable. The array hosts a high-definition seafloor camera system (CamHD) which surveys a hydrothermal vent and bacterial mat colonies on the seafloor every three hours. For approximately three years the camera has accumulated over 100 TB of video data showing these mats and the potential effects of seismic, magmatic, and hydrothermal processes on the bacterial colonies in this environment. In this project you will use a Dask-enabled Python image analysis pipeline to establish a bacterial mat “colonization quotient” to study the temporal evolution of these organisms, and consider potential relationships between the bacterial activity and geological and geophysical processes.

### Skills Required
Python programming, image analysis
